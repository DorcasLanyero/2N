## Instructions

[Not working in Alpha]

To play, use the arrow keys to move the tiles around the board.  When a key is pressed, all the tiles that have room to move shift in that direction.  Tiles of equal value combine when run into each other.  When a tile of a certain value is produced (defaults to 2048) the game is won.
