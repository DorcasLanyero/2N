# 2N (Alpha)
Customized 2048 clone

## Instructions

[Not working in Alpha]

To play, use the arrow keys to move the tiles around the board.  When a key is pressed, all the tiles that have room to move shift in that direction.  Tiles of equal value combine when run into each other.  When a tile of a certain value is produced (defaults to 2048) the game is won.

Model logic is not fully functinal. The program breaks after one move.

The demo is not audible. All that is being demonstarated is navigation from the start screen to the different screens available in the game. These are the about screen, the help screen, the difficulty screen and the game screen. The About screen contains basic information about the game,  the developers and the specifications. The Help screen consists of some guide lines on how to navigate around and how to play the game. The difficulty screen contains afew buttons from which the user can select the level of diffuculty they would love to use for their game. The timer is at the top of the game screen.
